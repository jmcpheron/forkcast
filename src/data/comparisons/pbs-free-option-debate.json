This creates what critics call a 'free option' - builders can observe market conditions for 6 seconds before deciding whether to reveal their block."

While critics worry about empty blocks during volatility, proponents argue that builder reputation, competition, and the relatively short option window make this a manageable trade-off for the significant benefits PBS provides. The truth likely lies somewhere in between - it's a concern worth addressing through careful mechanism design, but not necessarily a fatal flaw."
