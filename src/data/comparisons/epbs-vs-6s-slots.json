      "reasoning": "While both proposals have merit, I strongly prefer ePBS. The relay oligopoly represents a clear and present danger to Ethereum's credible neutrality that grows worse every month we delay. The free option problem, while real, is overstated - practical constraints like builder-searcher relationships, reputation systems, and the visibility of revealed payloads make it difficult to exploit profitably. We can further mitigate risks with asymmetric payments and shorter reveal windows. In contrast, 6-second slots offer a nice UX improvement but can be implemented in any future fork. We shouldn't let theoretical game theory concerns kill a critical decentralization upgrade when the alternative is continued relay dominance."
