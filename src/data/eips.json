This validation only happens once at deployment time and only affects new EOF contracts - existing legacy contracts remain unchanged. The goal is to make bytecode more predictable and easier to reason about, while ensuring all EVM implementations handle code the same way."

These instructions are more gas-efficient than traditional JUMP/JUMPI instructions, don't require JUMPDEST markers, and make code analysis easier. RJUMP does unconditional jumps, RJUMPI does conditional jumps, and RJUMPV provides jump tables for switch-case scenarios. The relative addressing means code can be moved around without breaking, and the static nature allows for better optimization and validation at deployment time."

Dynamic jumps (JUMP/JUMPI) are completely removed in favor of static function calls, making contracts more predictable and easier to optimize. A return stack tracks function call history, and JUMPDEST becomes a simple NOP instruction since jump analysis is no longer needed."

Only CALLF and JUMPF instructions need runtime stack overflow checks. The validation also prevents deployment of unreachable code and ensures proper function termination. This creates guarantees that enable better compiler optimizations and ahead-of-time compilation while maintaining linear validation complexity."

Functions can jump to other functions with fewer outputs, and non-returning functions don't need to clean up extra stack items before terminating."

They return extensible status codes (0=success, 1=revert, 2=failure) instead of boolean values, remove output buffer complexity in favor of RETURNDATACOPY, and add RETURNDATALOAD for efficient return data access.

The transaction data contains an EOF initcontainer followed by calldata for constructor arguments. This approach allows existing deployment tooling to work without modification - developers can deploy EOF contracts the same way they deploy legacy contracts, just by concatenating constructor arguments with the initcontainer. The execution ends with a RETURNCODE instruction that specifies which subcontainer becomes the deployed contract."

With this EIP, both regular users (EOAs) and smart contracts can deploy EOF contracts by including the contract code directly in transaction data and using TXCREATE to deploy it. This works alongside the existing EOFCREATE instruction, giving developers all the contract creation capabilities they had before EOF. The TXCREATE instruction can also deploy legacy contracts, making it a universal bootstrapping mechanism for getting EOF contracts onto the blockchain."

The new metadata section solves these issues by being unreachable by contract execution, unchanging after deployment, and clearly separated from functional code. This makes source code verification much easier and ensures that contracts with identical logic but different metadata will have the same executable bytecode."

The problem it solves is that EOF removes the ability to read raw contract code, but contracts still need to know when an account is delegating execution to another address. This instruction takes an address and returns the actual address that will execute the code - for regular accounts it returns the same address, but for delegated accounts it returns the address they're delegating to. This enables important use cases like managed proxy contracts ensuring they don't delegate to unsafe addresses, sponsorship contracts verifying delegation hasn't changed during a transaction, and security-conscious contracts that only accept specific delegation targets."

Currently, when blob demand exceeds supply, it takes too long for prices to climb from the extremely low minimum to actual market rates. The new minimum corresponds to about 1 cent at current ETH prices, similar to the cost of a simple transaction when gas fees are low. The change also resets excess blob gas to zero to prevent a sudden price spike when the upgrade activates. This helps blob-based rollups reach appropriate pricing faster during high-demand periods."

    "laymanDescription": "This automatically makes error messages from failed transactions easily accessible by emitting them as logs. Currently, when a transaction fails (reverts), the error message explaining why it failed is hard to get - you need to request expensive transaction tracing to access it. This creates overhead for users who want to understand why their transaction failed and for nodes that have to replay entire transactions just to extract small error messages. This EIP solves the problem by automatically emitting a log containing the revert message whenever the REVERT opcode is called. This makes error messages accessible through standard RPC calls without any tracing, helping wallets, block explorers, and other tools display helpful error messages to users. It's completely backward compatible and doesn't require any new opcodes or RPC methods."

    "laymanDescription": "This addresses a fundamental scalability bottleneck by separating transaction data from consensus data in Ethereum blocks. Currently, beacon blocks contain all transaction data embedded within them, but as Ethereum aims to increase block sizes (potentially by 10x), this creates serious networking and processing problems. Larger transaction payloads cause higher latencies for block transmission, increased bandwidth requirements, and longer block processing times that hurt validator performance. This EIP solves these issues by replacing the full transaction data in beacon blocks with just a header, while transmitting the actual transaction data separately. This allows the consensus layer to process blocks quickly while handling much larger transaction payloads independently. Additional benefits include reduced storage requirements for beacon nodes, more efficient proposer-builder separation, and laying groundwork for future innovations like ZK-proof-based execution validation where transaction data could be handled similarly to blobs with data availability sampling."

    ],
    "laymanDescription": "This removes the 49,152-byte limit on initialization code (initcode) that was introduced by EIP-3860. The problem this solves is that the current limit makes it unnecessarily difficult to deploy large, complex smart contracts that need to create multiple sub-contracts in a single transaction. For example, if you want to deploy a sophisticated DeFi protocol that consists of several interconnected contracts, you might hit the initcode limit even though each final contract stays under the 24KB deployed code limit (EIP-170). This forces developers to split deployments across multiple transactions, which is more expensive, less efficient, and breaks the clean abstractions that high-level programming languages try to provide. By removing this artificial limit, the EIP allows for more flexible deployment patterns while still maintaining security through existing gas costs that scale with initcode size. The per-block gas limit already naturally restricts initcode to reasonable sizes (around 16MB at current gas limits), making the 49KB cap redundant. This change is fully backward compatible and only removes restrictions without changing how contracts work."

    "laymanDescription": "This adds practical stack manipulation tools to the EVM without requiring the complex EOF format. It extends the existing SWAP and DUP instructions to reach deeper stack positions (up to 24 positions), adds dynamic SWAPN and DUPN instructions for variable depth access, and introduces an EXCHANGE instruction that can swap any two arbitrary stack positions. These tools help compilers generate more efficient code when dealing with complex functions that have many local variables, reducing gas costs and bytecode size. Unlike previous attempts that required new code formats, this proposal works with existing legacy contracts by requiring specific PUSH instructions before the dynamic operations, making it a pragmatic solution that provides better stack access without breaking backward compatibility."
